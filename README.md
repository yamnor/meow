## What is Meow?

**Meow** is an easy-to-use tool designed for sharing formatted text. You can type in the editor and click the `SHARE` button to generate a link. This link contains everything you've written, enabling you to share it without relying on a server. It provides a simple and secure way to share your text.

You can check available editor shortcuts [here](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/core-concepts/keyboard-shortcuts#predefined-keyboard-shortcuts), though not all formatting options are supported.

## Meow 🐈, Meow 🐈, Quack 🦆

**Meow** was inspired by the web app [**Quack**](https://beta.quack.page), created by [Good Enough LLC](https://goodenough.us). While **Quack's** approach of sharing content via links sparked the idea behind **Meow**, the critical difference is that **Meow** uses a WYSIWYG (*What You See Is What You Get*) editor, allowing for more intuitive, real-time editing.

However, **Meow** has some limitations compared to **Quack**—it doesn't support features like image display, making it a more streamlined, text-focused tool.
